BiDi algorithms issues:

* Change code to support latest revisions of the unicode technical report.

* Support LRE, RLE, RLO and LRO.

General issues:

* Clean up code

* Optimize binary searches.

* Better documentation

* Write some utility programs.

* Is it worthwile to make the library shared? Comments?

* Write notes and a reference implementation for the following interactions
  with fribidi:

    - Terminal editing with cursor key interaction, e.g. through curses.
      No mouse or cut and paste interaction.

    - Like above (with fixed fonts?) but in an GUI environment where 
      the mouse may be used to position the cursor.

    - Like above but with the ability to do a mouse selection. At least
      in logical mode, possibly in visual mode.

    - Like above but with proportional fonts.

    - Like above with proportional fonts and character attributes.

    - Like above but with kerning between characters.

* Write a description of the needed steps to convert a LTR editor into a
  BiDi aware editor.

* Make interfaces to other scripting languages if there is any interest.

* Consider the implications of a minimal incremental algorithm for
  adding a single character.
