I have relased a new version 0.1.2 of fribidi with the following changes:

	* Added options -ltr and -rtl to fribidi to force LTR and RTL 
	  directions.

	* Added function fribidi_log2vis_get_embedding_levels() which
	  just returns an array of embedding levels.

	* Added benchmark program.

	* Added new check in test_fribidi that checks the changes 
	  calculation.

	* Changed interface to fribidi_log2vis() to include length of
	  string on input and the embedding level of output.
	
	* Added function fribidi_find_string_changes() which finds the
	  bounding box of the changes between two FriBidiStrings.

Here's the blurb in case someone missed it:

FriBidi is a free BiDi library that adhers closely to the Unicode BiDi
algorithm.

FriBidi is written in C and should provide a common API that will 
facilitate porting of various software to support BiDirection 
locals.

FriBidi may be found at:

Here is an example of what the library can do, where capital letters
are treated as having Right-To-Left direction.
