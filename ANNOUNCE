I have relased a new version 0.1.1 of fribidi with the following changes:

    * Added program fribidi as a command line interface to the library.

    * Added flag -nopad to test_fribidi to make it not insert spaces.

    * Make P1 rules (ES and CS) work only if the span of the ES or
      the CS is 1. This is the same as in Hebrew Windoze.

    * Replaced all the ET rules with the simpler ET,EN=>EN,EN

    * Added `gtk-config --cflags` and `gtk-config -ldflags` to Makefile.am.

    * Made test_fribidi read from stdin if no file given.

    * Added options -outputonly to test_fribidi .


Here's the blurb in case someone missed it:

FriBidi is a free BiDi library that adhers closely to the Unicode BiDi
algorithm.

FriBidi is written in C and should provide a common API that will 
facilitate porting of various software to support BiDirection 
locals.

FriBidi may be found at:

Here is an example of what the library can do, where capital letters
are treated as having Right-To-Left direction.
