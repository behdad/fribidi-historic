I am proud to announce the first alpha version of a FriBidi, a 
Free BiDi library that adhers closely to the Unicode BiDi algorithm.

FriBidi is written in C and should provide a common API that will 
facilitate porting of various software to support BiDirection 
locals.

FriBidi may be found at:

Here is an example of what the library can do, where capital letters
are treated as having Right-To-Left direction.
